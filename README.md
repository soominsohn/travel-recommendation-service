The purpose of the project is to recommend travel destinations in Seoul according to user's preferences, while COVID-19 cases are rising, and to inform users of areas with small floating population by utilizing travel data and Seoul's floating population data.  
  
Travel destination data is from 서울열린데이터광장(data.seoul.kr) and additional data was obtained by web crawling from Naver Place and Google Images. Seoul floating population dataset is from SKT Data Hub. Data time ranges from 14 September 2020 to 21 September 2020, and only 20's floating population was used for the service targets users in their 20's.  
  
Our web application consists of eight pages and the main functions are travel recommendation, adding new places, leaving reviews, and getting up-to-date information of regional floating population. XAMPP(PHP and MySQL) was used for server development.
